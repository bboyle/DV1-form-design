	<h1>Domestic and Family Violence Safety Form</h1>

	<p>Queensland Courts Service is committed to providing a safe environment in the
	courthouse. Courthouses have safety measures in place such as safe rooms (or
	other rooms or areas where a person seeking protection can wait separately). Most
	courthouses also have security officers and security cameras.</p>

	<p>Court staff follow domestic violence protocols which place safety as top priority for all
	people seeking protection from domestic violence.</p>

	<p>If you have safety concerns about attending court that should be brought to the
	attention of court staff and the registrar, please complete the following and give this
	form to court staff. The court staff will copy the form and give it to the security officer,
	domestic violence protection worker, registrar and any other relevant court staff to
	arrange for your safety. It will also be placed on your court file, but will not be part of
	the application and will not be served on the respondent.</p>

	<p>If your safety concerns change for future court dates, you should complete another
	safety form for court staff.</p>
